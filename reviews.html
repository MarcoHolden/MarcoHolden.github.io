        Forgot how powerful the ending was. To me the character was very satisfying at times and frustrating at others. Despite his oddities he sticks even till death to his intrinsic values. He isn`t Camus`s ideal “absurd man” but after reading the Myth of Sisyphus his character trope makes much more sense.
        
        Quick read but fairly interesting. My friend read it and said it made him feel uncomfortable, not me though.

        Great read. The ending was less powerful than expected in my opinion however I`m glad they ended it how they did. It was satisfying. I haven`t been able to give it a deep review and may come back once I think it over more so.

        I read this during covid and it was striking to see the comparisons that could be made. The author reproduces the perfect mix of ignorance/disblief of the events unfolding along side hysteria. The way people profit and suffer intertwine and the result makes making progress slow. Bureaucracy is good until it isn't and the complex relationships that blossom or perish due to the plague were well discribed. I saw these in the people who surrounded me during covid, sometimes it was nuanced other times it was pronounced. A good read definetly worth giving a hindsighted opinion.

        One of my favorite reads. Very interesting how the author plays with time. An odd and satisfying conclusion that gives the whole book deeper meaning. Filled with a lot of substance, this book could definitely be re-read.

        <img class="image" src="lordoftheflys.jpg" draggable="false" alt="Lord of the Flies" data-review="Lord of the Flies by William Golding (Finished Sept 14th)

        The lord of the flies truly shows the trials of trying to live with others. It shows the danger of hysteria, ununified forces, and anarchy. The evil side of humanity which stealthly sneaks up and forces itself upon others. The story is told with children however, the adults at war reflect those same attributes. This puts a mirror up to us as readers. Ironically the children think what would the adults do, this being to their detrement. The story paints man as the beast, the same type of beast they all were afraid of, dangerous to man and habitat alike.
        
        I liked the story. I wish I had less distractions when reading it. I think it was a solid 8/10
