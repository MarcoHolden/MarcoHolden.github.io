        I forgot how powerful the ending was. To me, the character was very satisfying at times and frustrating at others. Despite his oddities, he sticks even until death to his intrinsic values. He isn`t Camus`s ideal “absurd man” but after reading the Myth of Sisyphus his character trope makes much more sense.
        
        A quick read but fairly interesting. My friend read it and said it made him feel uncomfortable, not me though.

        Great read. The ending was less powerful than expected in my opinion however I'm glad they ended it how they did. It was satisfying. I haven't been able to give it a deep review and may come back once I think it over more so.

        I read this during covid and it was striking to see the comparisons that could be made. The author reproduces the perfect mix of ignorance/disbelief of the events unfolding alongside hysteria. The way people profit and suffer intertwine and the result makes progress slow. Bureaucracy is good until it isn't and the complex relationships that blossom or perish due to the plague were well described. I saw these in the people who surrounded me during covid, sometimes it was nuanced other times it was pronounced. A good read, worth giving a hindsight opinion all this time later.

        <img class="image" src="borderliners.jpg" draggable="false" alt="Borderliners" data-review="Borderliners by Peter Høeg (Start May 28th, Finished June 16th)
        
        One of my favorite reads. Very interesting how the author plays with time. An odd and satisfying conclusion that gives the whole book deeper meaning. Filled with a lot of substance, this book could be re-read. It was one of my first stories with this type of narrator. The stories touched upon by each individual were raw and powerful. Two points in the story stick out, the discussion of the swing set and the heater. I found both to be eye-opening to the mental state of the children and the lives they lived.
        
        One of my recent favorites, would not recommend it to everyone because I don't want to hear bad things about it.

        A fantastic philosophical book with a very particular way of delivery. Thoughts that I've been numb to were expressed very well and were quite palatable. Very stimulating and once I picked it up I couldn't put it down.

        I enjoyed the book at the start, a great collection of short stories that all have social commentary. The first two stories resonated well with me along with a handful in the middle. The use of outer space as a focus point got old. I'd give some stories a better rank than others, ranging from 10/10 to 5/10. The overall story is 6.8/10.

        <img class="image" src="lordoftheflys.jpg" draggable="false" alt="Lord of the Flies" data-review="Lord of the Flies by William Golding (Start unsure, Finished Sept 14th)

        The story 'Lord of the Flies' truly shows the trials of trying to live with others. It shows the danger of hysteria, ununified forces, and anarchy. The evil side of humanity stealthily sneaks up and forces itself upon others. The story is told with children however, the adults at war reflect those same attributes. This puts a mirror up to us as readers. Ironically the children think 'what would the adults do', this being to their detriment. The story paints man as the beast, the same type of beast they all were afraid of, dangerous to man and habitat alike.
        
        I liked the story. I wish I had fewer distractions when reading it. I think it was a solid 8/10

        The Alchemist does a great job of following a theme throughout its content. Each section adds to the last and allows the reader to stay engaged from start to finish. The message of following your dreams felt inspiring to me and the ending made me quite happy. However, after finishing I realized that I never really had a simple dream to follow. I never wanted to be a doctor, lawyer, or soccer player. I may have wanted to do or accomplish some things but it was never more complex than being happy or becoming rich. I wish to have something to be as passionate about as the main character.
        
        Some notable points were the switch of being Shepard to going on the journey. The single use of the stones. The shop, the sand, the oasis, the military camp, and the pyramids.

        <img class="image" src="notesofacrocodile.jpg" draggable="false" alt="Notes of a Crocodile" data-review="Notes Of A Crocodile by Qui Miaojin(translated by Bonnie Hui) (Start unsure, finished on Dec 20th)
        
        There are many things I love about this book. To start its opening is a favorite, and if the entire book had that consistent quality it could have easily been 9/10 or higher. Second I loved the metaphors and word choice, they weren't all perfect but the way the writer was able to express ideas was very new to me and enjoyable. Notably was a line about acid on limestone. I loved the allusion to philosophy and different philosophers. Finally, I loved the ending and the character development that came with it.
        
        Some notable points were the beginning with the finger cut off(grotesque and odd). The constant crocodile metaphor for I'm not sure what(I think being lesbian but more particularly being misunderstood). I liked the scene with Tun Tun and Zhu Rou where they banter with Lazi as they first meet. The ending with the recall of the five windows was also nice.
        
        “You were like acid on my limestone, unaware of how hardened I was. My sense of self had begun to disintegrate and I had to flee. Still, you know nothing of how it transformed me…”
        
        “Only healthy people are capable of being in love. Using love to treat an illness just makes the illness worse.' I realize that's exactly what I did: I used love to fight illness, and it ruined me. I have to change my ways. I can't be like that anymore.”
        
        The book was written very well. Not my typical read but worth it. Evoked emotion but couldn't bring me to tears or any heightened state of joy or anger. I think that's what I was looking for here so a 6.7/10 for the story. 8.7/10 for the style. 6/10 for the emotion. And an overall rating of 6.9/10. (Worth re-reading in one or two sittings instead of spread out)">
        <img class="image" src="theegg.jpg" draggable="false" alt="The Egg" data-review="The Egg and Other Stories by Andy Weir (Start unsure, Finished January 22nd 2023)

        This was a collection of short stories. They ranged from interesting/surprising to sad and scary. Each story (except “Bored World”) was well worth the listen. Notable ones include “The Real Deal” a sad story that deals with dementia, “The Chef” a sad/twisted story about a mentally ill patient, and “The Egg” an interesting story about death. I would have to say this story was one of the most satisfying reads I've done. I think that The Egg could also be seen as the threading in the book. This is because each character when they die(in theory) would join their consciousness.

        This collection of short stories reminded me of the illustrated man due to its format. I gave the illustrated man a 6.8 out of 10 and this collection of short stories solidified that judgment. These stories had creative surprises and a more consistent delivery. They had a solid amount of deviation and maintained a threading of structure. Set up, diversion, twist. Each twist genuinely surprised me.

        I'd give this a 9.04 out of 10. It was gripping, rewarding, and it didn't drag on. A point was made then the subject moved on. Of course, one story not hitting is okay but that is why it did not receive a 10/10. This format naturally makes it easier to hold an audience and provide consistent entertainment. A ten out of ten is possible but I will reserve it only when each page is gold for this format. More methodically if each sentence/page/chapter adds significantly or preps purposefully rather than subtracts or is of waist. Longer stories will need to deal with this same criteria, of course, this is much harder, and therefore short stories will be more likely to receive higher grades.
