        Running with the bulls isn't just an adrenaline rush; it's a profound lesson in embracing life with all its risks and unpredictability. By facing the charging bulls, you symbolically confront your deepest fears and uncertainties. This act of courage teaches you to live boldly, reminding you that true growth comes from stepping out of your comfort zone. In essence, running with the bulls is about seizing the day and understanding that to fully experience life, you must sometimes dare to dance with danger.">
        <img class="image" src="finlandclimbing.png" draggable="false" alt="Finland Climbing" data-review="Bucket List Item 2: Climbing in Finland
        
        One of the standout climbs that draws professionals to Finland is 'Burden of Dreams'. It's a notorious route known for its technical difficulty and impressive setting. Climbers like Will Bosi have taken on this challenge, mastering intricate sequences on sheer granite faces. The climb demands both physical strength and mental focus, as climbers try to hit small holds and have precise movements with no room for error. The allure of 'Burden of Dreams' lies not just in its technicality but also in the world class challenge that it poses. The climb is quite litterly the hardest boulder with a grade of V17. I would love to get a chance to climb in Finland and take a look at the rock that has beaten so many rock climbing legends.">
        <img class="image" src="Windmill.png" draggable="false" alt="Windmill" data-review="Bucket List Item 3: Standing on a Windmill
        
        On one of the main roads near my house you can see a Windmill spinning around and around. I imagine they are quite loud and the view is probably pretty incredible. I think the inside would be a bright white and have a musky metalic smell. The way up would be a ladder with protection from falling backwards. I feel like ocnce you are on top the wind will be strong and the sun bright. I don't know where i got the idea to be on the top of one but ever since I did it's been on the list. I would like to go with a professional windmill mechanic or engineer. Perhaps learn some of the mechanics on how it generates and stores energy.">

        <img class="image" src="redwood.jpeg" draggable="false" alt="Redwood" data-review="Bucket List Item 6: Visit Redwood Forest
        
        My parents always took me on hikes as a kid and I would begrundgingly tag along thinking about all the bettter things I could be doing. Now we go on adventures nearly every week visiting some of the incredible nature spots Virginia has. I started to take on the same love that my parents had for the outdoors. There are places all around the world worth going to see but you don't have to go that far to exerience beauty. Within the U.S. there's an abundance of areas that one can go. The Redwood Forest is on the top of my list of places to go but its not limited to this. I want to see the Badlands/Cluster State Park (Needles Highway), Grand Cayon, and of course travel on Hana Highway in Hawaii. I heard Montana is beautiful and Alaska has some incredible spots. Colarado and Maine how could I not! I live on the north east and everytime I go back it becomes more and more stunning. The Redwood marks my love for nature and that's why it is on the list.">
        <img class="image" src="Iceland.webp" draggable="false" alt="Iceland" data-review="Bucket List Item 7: Go to Iceland
        
        Following the same theme as before with beauty of nature, you don't get much better than Iceland. In highschool a small group was able to convince our advisor to have a class trip there. We were planning this for over a year for a special senior event. Sadly, covid had wiped out tourism towards the end of our Junior year into Senior year. The plans were canceled, refunds for down payments were fought for and the trip became a phantom of the past. I want to go here with my family, so manyof us were thinking about going. Now once I have a job, my hope is that I'll be able to one day buy tickets for us all to go. It would be my way to show appreciation for all the great things they've done for me. Plus, I have a friend that lives there so I should make he trip anyways if he is around.">
        <img class="image" src="Island.jpg" draggable="false" alt="Island" data-review="Bucket List Item 8: Celebrate New Years First
        
        The idea of celebrating new years first is silly but, I want to do it. Kiritimati Island is known to be the first to celebrate each year, so the plan is to get tickets there and then celebrate new years there. That being said Kiritimati is 'the only country to cover all four hemispheres of the Earth' so the actual place in Kiritimati to celebrate is key as well. The exact place is called Christmas Island and is called such because it is the first to celebrate Christmas as well. The Island is sinking and so I would love to go there before it is gone, luckily sinking is usually a centuries problem not decades one.">        
        <img class="image" src="WallaceLine.jpeg" draggable="false" alt="Wallace Line" data-review="Bucket List Item 9: Travel to the Wallace Line
        
        Supposedly the Wallace Line has an 'Invisible Barrier' that animals refuse to cross, the reason for this is hypothesized to be from tectonic activity where two different biogeographic regions drifted towards each other and now are only 22 miles apart. This means that the animals and plants form both side are coming from drasticly different backgrounds. I would love to go from one side to the other and observe the differences myself.">        
        <img class="image" src="Petra.webp" draggable="false" alt="Petra" data-review="Bucket List Item 9: Travel to Petra
        
        Petra is actually one of the places I know very little about. I've only seen the entrance from photos and I hope to keep the place a relative unkown till I get the chance to go. To have a structure like that it must have an incredible inside with a interesting story behind it's origins. I don't like spoilers in movies and this feels like it could be straight out of one so I would like to experince it with minimal knowledge exept maybe historical signifigance. A hard no more photos though, I only look up the entrance and never scroll further than what is shown.">
        <img class="image" src="Machu_Picchu.jpeg" draggable="false" alt="Machu Pichu" data-review="Bucket List Item 10: Travel to Machu Pichu
        
        Machu Pichu is another one of the places I know very little about. I was told by a couple of friends of how amazing it is, the entire country is supposedly stunning and rich in nature and culture. I've only seen the some photos and once again I hope to keep the place a relative unkown till I get the chance to go. That being said I would love a tour guide for both to ensure that the stories it holds can be told to me while I'm there.">
        <img class="image" src="3Stars.jpeg" draggable="false" alt="Three Star Restraunt" data-review="Bucket List Item 11: Eat at a Three Star Michelin Restraunt
        
        I have hopes of incredible textures and taste. Dishes designed to be perfectly plated and every meal a unique expereince. Food is a staple in our lives and to eat what is concidered to be the pinnical of cooking, incredible. I exicted to see how a restraunt can push the meaning of food in new and exciting ways. I don't need to eat incredible food all the time, I'm fine with simple and practical in my daily life. I try to live simplisticly in order to save up for exciting new experiences. I rather play board games, cards, chat, volunteer or go for local walks and save up compared to spend abundently on shopping sprees, fancy nights out, and partying. If you have about 7 drinks a week (78% of men do) at a dollar a day for beer at the end of the year thats $364, two years of no beer is $728. Masa the most expensive three star restraunt in New Yor costs $750. Le Bernardin another three star restraunt costs $90-$190. That's a trade I'm willing to make.">
        <img class="image" src="wagusteak.webp" draggable="false" alt="Wagu" data-review="Bucket List Item 12: Eat A5 Wagu Steak
        
        This is as high class as it gets with a proper steak as far as I'm concerned. With a price point in the thousands a dish with this sort of steak is either all hype or is something one could only dream of. I have no clue what I would be getting with this sort of product. The urge to try what is considered the best you can get for steak is undeniable for me. I'm not the biggest meat eater but, I've been captivated with this.">
        <img class="image" src="Lucuma.webp" draggable="false" alt="Lucuma" data-review="Bucket List Item 13: Try Lucuma
        
        My first time trying this fruit was at an icecream shop from my best friend's girlfriend. She was all praise for this fruit saying it was a must try. I'm always curious about trying new things and after we had the conversation I decided right then and there to add it to my list.">
        <img class="image" src="Durian.png" draggable="false" alt="Durian" data-review="Bucket List Item 14: Eat a Durian Fruit
        
        Known as 'the king of fruits' by some and 'the stinkiest fruit' by others. This fruit's potentent smell suposedly doesn't indicate tastes with discriptions of it tasting like custard, caramel, or even cheesecake. I want to know how true this is and get one for myself. Hopefully, with a group of people so we can all discuss how rank we find the fruit and see if anyone backs out. Afterall, these sorts of things are best as shared experinces.">
        <img class="image" src="Volcano.png" draggable="false" alt="Volcano" data-review="Bucket List Item 15: See a Volcano Erupt

        Perhaps this isn't the safest thing to watch but it would definetly be an interesting experience. I wouldn't want to see a giant explosion in person because of the implications but a tiny eruption would still be cool. Lava and magma are incredibly rich for the earth and lay the groundwork for plants. There is a good reason why some of the best farmland is near volcanos. Point being I would love to see mother nature at work.">
        <img class="image" src="Globe.png" draggable="false" alt="Globe" data-review="Bucket List Item 16: Go to Every Continent

        The world is so incredibly large with rich history, stunning landscapes, stories, people and animals. I want to embrace new ideas and learn about the world around me. I know that going to every country would take ages and be a bureaucratic nightmare. That being said at the very least I would like to travel to every continent, I have already been to North America and Europe (I've been to Central America but I won't count that as South America). I have people I wish to see all over the world. The list include's but is not limited to Lithuania, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Poland, China, Bulgaria, Korea, Japan, Nigeria, Sweden, Columbia, Greece, Iceland and Tunisia. Of course if I ever end up getting to hit all those place I might as get the rest of the continents as well.">
